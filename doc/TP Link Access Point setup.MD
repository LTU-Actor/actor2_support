# TP Link EAP 225 setup instructions
The TP Link _EAP_ (Extensible Authentication Protocol) access point is configured like most routers.

Requirements:
* windows

## Accessing configuration tool

1. Connect the access point through the powered adapter that is included.
    * connection from physical access point to EAP port
    * connection from windows machine to LAN port

2. Connect to the wireless network provided by the access point (i.e. TP_Link_xxxx)

3. Set a static ip with the wireless connection:
    * 192.168.0.[2-250]

4. Open browser and navigate to default access point ip: 192.168.0.254

With these steps, hopefully, the TP Link login screen will appear.
The default credentials are _admin_ for both username and password.
